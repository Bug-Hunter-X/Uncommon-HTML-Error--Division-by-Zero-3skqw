# Uncommon HTML Error: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error that can occur in HTML: division by zero within a script tag.  This error will halt the execution of the JavaScript code. It's an example of how unexpected runtime errors can impact the functionality of an HTML page.

The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.html` demonstrates how to prevent this error using a simple `if` condition to check for division by zero before the calculation.
